# CSE_6250
Big Data For Healthcare Final Project: Learning From Sleep Data
Team 24: Tim Wilcox


## Introduction
This repository contains programs in two languages: *Apache Spark* and *Python*. The Spark program processes **.edf** files into spectral density estimates of the following waveforms:
  * EEG
  * ECG
  * EMG

**Note:** Before you run either program, you must put the polysomnogram data (.edf files) in the ./scala/data _AND_ the data must have EEG, EMG, and ECG signals present. 

## 1. Feature Engineering with Apache Spark
Open a terminal in the root directory and run the following:

```
(cd scala/ ; sbt compile run)
```

This process will take some time depending on the number of .edf files to read. On average, the full [Sleep Heart Health Study](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs) SHHS1 dataset takes just under 9 hours to process approximately 5,800 files. At the conclusion of the operation, Spark has been configured to save the processed files in the './scala/output/Periodograms.csv/' directory. Use this location for the classification step.

## 2. Classification with Python3

You may choose to run the CVD_Diagnosis.py file on its own or through a Jupyter Notebook for greater interactivity and control. Either way, the structure is as follows:

*class* CVD_Diagnosis (*path*)
  The main class for classifying data from the spark output dataframe.
  **Parameter**
  >`path` \[String\] : the local path to the output of the Spark dataframe
  
  **Returns**
  >`self`
  
  **Attributes**
  >`X' \[numpy.ndarray\[numpy.float64\]\]: The feature vector. Each row represents one patient and each column contains the PSD estimate for one frequency bin of the periodogram for each of three signals. X[0:250] represents the EEG periodogram, X[250:500] represents the ECG periodogram, and X[500:750] represents the EMG periodogram.
